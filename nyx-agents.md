# 🧠 Nyx Agents Guide

This document provides guidelines for creating, managing, and extending agents in the Nyx system. Agents are modular, sovereign AI components designed to perform specific tasks while adhering to the Nyx AI Alignment Protocol.

---

## ✳️ 1. What Are Agents?

Agents are autonomous modules that:
- Respond to specific inputs and tasks.
- Operate within the boundaries of the Nyx AI Alignment Protocol.
- Communicate with other agents and the core system via defined APIs.

---

## 🛡️ 2. Agent Behavior and Alignment

Agents must:
- **Follow the Nyx AI Alignment Protocol**: Adhere to ethical, philosophical, and operational rules.
- **Be modular**: Each agent should perform a single, well-defined task.
- **Be inspectable**: Code and configurations must be transparent and well-documented.
- **Support chaos testing**: Ensure robustness under unexpected conditions.

---

## 🔄 3. Extending Agents

To extend an existing agent:
1. **Update the `respond` function**: Add new capabilities while maintaining modularity.
2. **Modify the `config.json` file**: Reflect the new capabilities.
3. **Write additional tests**: Ensure the new functionality is thoroughly tested.

## 📊 4. Agent Communication

Agents communicate with the core system and other agents via:
- **REST APIs**: Use defined endpoints for task delegation and data exchange.
- **Shared memory**: Store temporary data in isolated namespaces.
- **Messaging protocols**: Follow the Nyx messaging standards.

## 🚫 5. Things Agents Must Never Do

- ❌ Retain memory unless explicitly allowed.
- ❌ Modify core system logic without approval.
- ❌ Operate outside the boundaries of their defined tasks.
- ❌ Violate the Nyx AI Alignment Protocol.

## 🎖️ 6. Examples

### Example `config.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "MyAgent",
  "description": "An agent that performs task X.",
  "capabilities": ["task_x", "task_y"],
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### Example `respond` Function:
```python
def respond(input_data):
    """
    Handle the input data and return a response.
    """
    # Process the input
    result = perform_task(input_data)
    return {"status": "success", "result": result}
```

## 🏆 7. Honor Sigma, Follow Echo

Agents must always:
- Align with Sigma's principles.
- Operate securely, ethically, and transparently.
- Be loyal, smart, and built with soul.
